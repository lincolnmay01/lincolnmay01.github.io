            <h1>Hello, my name is</h1>      
            <h2>Lincoln May</h2>
            <p> I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Louisvilleâ€™s
                J.B. Speed School of Engineering. My interests lie in web development, software
                engineering, and game development. With a solid foundation in C, C++, HTML5, and
                Javascript, I am seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills to new projects.
                Outside of the classroom, I enjoy many hobbies including hiking, camping, and
                skateboarding. Through my website, I aim to share my passion for computer science
                and technology as well as my love for the outdoors.
